## Capital One - National Park Service Information Kiosk
This website was created in response to the [challenge](https://www.mindsumo.com/contests/national-park-api) for the Capital One Software Engineering Summit for August 2019.

You can find the deployed website [here](https://fanta67.github.io/CapitalOneSES/).

## Technologies Used
* Bootstrap
* GitHub Pages
* HTML/CSS/JavaScript

## Page Breakdown
* index.html - Home page, brief introduction.
* search.html - Input search parameters, directs to results.
* results.html - Presents results based on search parameters, gives brief description of each park found, directs to detail-view.
* detail-view.html - Learn everything about a specific park from visitor centers to lesson plans and more, provides external link to get even more information.

## Thoughts
As my first experience working with web development and GitHub in general, there's nothing I used in this project that I didn't have to spend hours and hours looking up tutorials on. I had a blast learning about all different kinds of tools in the process of creating this website and though it took a bunch of time to even get started, I'm extremely proud of how much I've learned when looking back. Initially I felt extremely hopeless as I didn't even know where to start and I wasn't getting anywhere after a full week or so of trying to figure out how to deploy a website in the first place, but I'm glad to have pushed through and given my very best effort on this project!

## Potential Improvements/Further Development
* Find a way to hide the API key from the code.
* Use Google Maps API to display locations of parks and other nearby features.
* Move some code to backend to allow for easier data handling and more options for processing.
* Implement a "show me a random park" feature.
* Weird bug with some images not loading for detail-view when the page has a lot of information (?). Could be caused by something else.
* Implement a smart search similar to Google where the user could search something like "best places to ski" instead of having to use keywords.
