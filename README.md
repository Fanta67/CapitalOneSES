## Capital One - National Park Service Information Kiosk

* Bootstrap
* GitHub Pages

## Thoughts
As my first experience working with web development and GitHub in general, there's nothing I used in this project that I didn't have to spend hours and hours looking up tutorials on. I had a blast learning about all different kinds of tools in the process of creating this webiste and though it took a bunch of time to even get started, I'm proud of how far I can see I've come when looking backwards. Initially I felt extremely hopeless as I didn't even know where to start and I wasn't getting anywhere after a full week or so of trying to figure out how to deploy a website in the first place, but I'm glad to have pushed through and given my very best effort on this project!

## Potential Improvements/Further Development
* Find a way to hide the API key from the code. 
* Use Google Maps API to display locations of parks and other nearby features.
* Move some code to backend to allow for easier data handling and more options for processing.
* Implement a "show me a random park" feature.
* Implement a smart search similar to Google where the user could search something like "best places to ski" instead of having to use keywords.
